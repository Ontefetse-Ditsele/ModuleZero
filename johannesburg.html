            Johannesburg, South Africa's biggest city and capital of Gauteng province, began as a 19th-century gold-mining settlement. <br/>
            Its sprawling Soweto township was once home to Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu.<br/>
            Mandelaâ€™s former residence is now the Mandela House museum. <br/>
            Other Soweto museums that recount the struggle to end segregation include the somber Apartheid Museum <br/>
            and Constitution Hill, a former prison complex
